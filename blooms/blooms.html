		<h1>Blooms Taxonomy</h1>
		<p>
			The updated Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational
			goals and objectives that was revised by a group of educators in 2001. The
			revised taxonomy builds upon the original taxonomy created by Benjamin
			Bloom in the 1950s, but includes a more modern and dynamic approach to
			learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The updated Bloom's Taxonomy includes six categories of cognitive skills
			that build upon one another in a hierarchical order:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remembering: Recall or recognize information, ideas, or concepts.</li>
			<li>
				Understanding: Comprehend the meaning of information, ideas, or
				concepts.
			</li>
			<li>
				Applying: Apply information, ideas, or concepts to a new situation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Analyzing: Break down information into parts and examine relationships
				among them.
			</li>
			<li>
				Evaluating: Make judgments about the value or quality of information,
				ideas, or concepts.
			</li>
			<li>
				Creating: Generate new ideas, products, or solutions by combining or
				synthesizing existing information, ideas, or concepts.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The updated Bloom's Taxonomy emphasizes that learning is an active and
			ongoing process, and that students must be actively engaged in the
			learning process in order to develop higher-order thinking skills. The
			framework also highlights the importance of scaffolding learning
			experiences to help students progress through each level of the taxonomy,
			and encourages teachers to design learning experiences that promote
			critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving.
		</p>
		<h2>Verbs used in Blooms taxonomy</h2>

			able to do as a result of a learning experience. They outline the specific
			knowledge, skills, or attitudes that learners are expected to acquire or
			demonstrate after completing a course, module, or lesson.
		</p>
		<p>
			Learning objectives should be clear, specific, measurable, and observable.
			They should also be aligned with the overall goals and outcomes of the
			course or program, and be relevant to the needs and interests of the
			learners.
		</p>
		<p>Examples of learning objectives might include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				By the end of the lesson, students will be able to identify the main
				characters in a story and describe their personalities and motivations.
			</li>
			<li>

				of basic arithmetic to solve everyday problems.
			</li>
			<li>
				By the end of the module, students will be able to explain the causes
				and effects of climate change, and propose strategies for mitigating its
				impacts.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Learning objectives are important because they help guide instructional
			design, assessment, and evaluation. They provide a clear roadmap for both
			teachers and learners, and help ensure that learning experiences are
			focused, relevant, and effective.
		</p>
		<h2>Agenda</h2>
